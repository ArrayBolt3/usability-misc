## SYNOPSIS
`upgrade-nonroot`

## Description
Runs '/usr/bin/apt-get-update-plus dist-upgrade' as root.

If 'user-sysmaint-split' is not installed, this works passwordless for any
user who is a member of group sudo, because of the
/etc/privleap/conf.d/usability-misc.conf and
/etc/sudoers.d/upgrade-passwordless configuration snippets.

If 'user-sysmaint-split' is installed, this works passwordless only if
the system is booted in 'sysmaint' mode.
