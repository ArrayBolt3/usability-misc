`pwchange`

## Description
Similar to the chpasswd(8) utility but showing the asterisk ("*") symbol while
typing the password for better usability.

Internally using chpasswd(8) to actually change the password.

Designed for interactive use using command line. For non-interactive use in
scripts use chpasswd(8) directly.
