## Prevents daemons from starting while using apt-get.
## Takes care of chroot mount from getting locked.

## Therefore for example prevents connecting to the public Tor network while
## building the images. This is interesting for (obfuscated) bridge users and
## also prevents sensitive data from the build machine, such as the Tor
## consensus /var/lib/tor leaking into the image.

## This file gets deleted by the build script at the end.
